<p> Père Lachaise you can take in the tombs of Jim Morrison, Edith Piaf,
   Chopin and a host of other big, big names, and you end up at Oscar Wilde’s
   tomb – a block-like item conceived by Jacob Epstein, with a modernist angel
   emerging from the block. It once had male genitalia, but these have been
   knocked off – not so much to keep Oscar’s mind on higher things through
   eternity as to provide the cemetery manager with a paper-weight.

  <img src = "mall.jpg" alt ="">
  <p>Cape Town’s St Georges Mall has always been one of the main
    arteries through the city – although today it is no longer the
    congested street it once was, but a leafy, stimulating
     pedestrianised thoroughfare linking the Foreshore to Government
      Avenue and the Company Gardens
