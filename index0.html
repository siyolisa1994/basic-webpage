  Everyone claims that whenever they visit New York,
  they get hooked; they catch the NYC bug, but it is
  so true! The view from Rockefeller Centre, the feeling
  you get walking over the Brooklyn Bridge, the
  heart-racing pulse from walking up 5th avenue and
  the sense of peacefulness whilst sitting in Central
  Park are just a few reasons why you should visit
  this incredible city.

      <h4>Good Hope</h4>
      <img src="images/castle.jpg">
      <p>The Castle of Good Hope was not built by Jan Van Riebeeck. A
         clay and timber fort was the first building to be erected in his time,
         and it was his suggestion that this be replaced by a more permanent
         structure that could withstand the elements and possible attacks.

      <h4>City Hall</h4>

      <img src="images/city(1).jpg">
      <p>The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the
         winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George
         Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott.
         Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was
         imported from Europe.</p>
