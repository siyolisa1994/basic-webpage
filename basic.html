           Chopin and a host of other big, big names, and you end up at Oscar Wilde’s
           tomb – a block-like item conceived by Jacob Epstein, with a modernist angel
           emerging from the block. It once had male genitalia, but these have been
           knocked off – not so much to keep Oscar’s mind on higher things through
           eternity as to provide the cemetery manager with a paper-weight.</p>

      Avenue and the Company Gardens
